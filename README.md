- 👋 Hi, I’m @tyfvf.
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly programming, but technology in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything!, i am doing a general course in Brazil, place where i live, it's my first course so i'm still learning about pretty much everything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... i don't know, probably i don't have enough knowledge to help with anything, unless it's a simple hello world 😅
- 📫 How to reach me, well with you need something, or talk to me, you can send me a email to tyfvf2@gmail.com, i always check.
